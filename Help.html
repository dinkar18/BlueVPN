            <h4>How can I check if I have connected successfully</h4>
            <p>After connecting to our servers, you might want to check if your connection is definitely secure. There
                are two main ways you can check that:

                Go to nordvpn.com and check the top of the page. The bar there should say that you are Protected if the
                connection is successful.
                You can also go to our IP check website. This way, you can know that the connection is successful.
                If you ever have any issues or questions with the connection or our service, feel free to contact our
                support team! They are always eager to help.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>Connecting from a country with internet restrictions</h4>
            <p>Enable the Obfuscated Servers feature in the NordVPN app settings and try connecting to the servers
                listed below:

                United Arab Emirates # 9-28;
                Singapore # 233-236, 240-258;
                France # 391-398;
                Japan # 254-274;
                United States # 4408-4419.

                If you can’t find the mentioned servers, your server list is most probably not up to date. Our
                recommendation would be to log out from the NordVPN app and log in again.

                To connect to these specific servers, click on the magnifying glass icon and search for the country and
                a server number with the hashtag.

                Example: Singapore #242.



                If you are trying to connect with iOS, please contact our customer support for the detailed instructions

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>Will I experience a DNS leak with NordVPN?</h4>
            <p>We have got our own DNS servers so there should be no leaks. If you still experience a DNS leak, please
                make sure you are connected to VPN and clean the cache and cookies from your browser.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>What is a Kill Switch and how does it work?
            </h4>
            <p>Kill Switch is a technology that terminates a process when the VPN connection drops. You can use it with
                our custom NordVPN software for Windows, macOS, Linux and iOS devices. You can find more information on
                this article.

                Note: The Kill Switch in the iOS app does not terminate any specific applications; instead, it disables
                the system-wide Internet access if you are not connected to a VPN server. It is available in NordVPN for
                iOS 2.2.2 or later.</p>

            <h4>What is Double VPN and how does it work?
            </h4>
            <p>Double VPN is a security solution when the data is encrypted twice through a multi-node farm. The
                encryption is double AES-256-CBC. The user connects to the first node, where the data is encrypted. Then
                the secured data travels to the second node, gets encrypted again and only then reaches the Internet.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>Where are your servers located?
            </h4>
            <p>Currently we have servers in Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica,
                Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland,
                India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, the Netherlands, New
                Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden,
                Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam. You
                can find a dynamic list here.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>Do you offer Socks5 proxies?</h4>
            <p>Yes, we do support Socks5 proxies as well as HTTP proxies (1 HTTP and Socks5 proxy at each of our VPN
                server destinations). More information can be found in our blog post.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>What bandwidth can I expect from your service?
            </h4>
            <p>It depends on various criteria. If you connect to the closest server, you may expect around 30% loss in
                bandwidth speed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>Do you offer any open ports?
            </h4>
            <p>All ports are open on our servers, except SMTP and Netbios for outgoing connections. For the SMTP
                incoming port, you can alternatively use ports 465 or 587. Of course, since we do not provide any
                port-forwarding, no incoming connections can go through.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>Do you support IPv6?
            </h4>
            <p>No, but we are planning to add the support of IPv6 in 2019.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>How many devices can be connected to NordVPN simultaneously with one account?</h4>
            <p>A total of 6 devices can be connected with one NordVPN account at the same time. However, there is one
                limitation. If you connect multiple devices to the same server, you must choose different protocols for
                the VPN connections (TCP and UDP are different protocols, so you can connect one device to TCP and the
                other to UDP). That means a total of 3 devices can be connected to the same server at once – through
                IKEv2, OpenVPN TCP and OpenVPN UDP. If you have three more devices at home, you can connect them to
                another server – again, with different protocols.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>What information do you store?
            </h4>
            <p>We do not store any logs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>How is my privacy maintained?
            </h4>
            <p>When you connect to NordVPN, a VPN “tunnel” is created. This is another word for a connection between you
                and our server. All data in this ‘’tunnel” is encrypted so that only you know the content of what is
                being sent. The data is encrypted with a 256-Bit key. This is an excellent level of security that allows
                maintaining good levels of performance, even on older machines and lower powered devices such as phones
                and netbooks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>Can I change my VPN username?</h4>
            <p>Yes, you can, but you will have to send us a request at support(at)nordvpn(dot)com. Please note that you
                might need to prove you are the owner of the account.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>How can I change my VPN password?</h4>
            <p>Please log in to your profile using your username and password. Select Change Password. Click the Send
                Reset Link button and check your inbox for an email from NordVPN. Follow the reset link to change the
                password.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="hlp1">
            <h4>I have lost/forgotten my username/password?
            </h4>
            <p>Go to the Lost Password page, enter your email address and press Get New Password. You will receive an
                email to confirm that you want to retrieve your password. Click the link in the email, and you will
                shortly receive another email with a temporary password. Please log in to your profile using your
                temporary password and choose a new password. Please note that you will not be able to use the temporary
                password for VPN connections.</p>
