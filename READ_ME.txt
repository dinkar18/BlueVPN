The website consist of many pages. The homepage is the main page of website. You can scroll through various pages. From header to footer, each and every necesaary page is there.

I have tried to make a complete website so it have mainly all the pages. there are even links insides pages which open have their own links. you don't have to login in order to acess the website.

when a user choose a specific plan, a popup will apper inorder to complete the payment.

in account page, you have to login using username "admin" and password "1234"
in case of wrong password, it will show wrong email or password.
in case of right password, it will redirect you to pricing page where you can buy the plan you want to.
if you visit pricing before login, it will show as normal page with login as (nothing) but in case you will login, it will show login as (admin) in pricing page.

Hope you like my work
Thank you
