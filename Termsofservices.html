            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="sml-grey">Last updated July 24, 2019</p>

        </div>

        <div class="privacy1">
            <p>These terms of service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of NordVPN services, therefore we
                kindly ask you to carefully read them when visiting NordVPN website, before you register, download,
                install and use the NordVPN services, which include the NordVPN software, NordVPN mobile applications
                and any services that NordVPN (“we,” “us,” “our,” or “NordVPN”) provides through our software,
                application or otherwise (all of which collectively are referred as the “NordVPN Services”). NordVPN is
                provided by Tefincom S.A.

                Please note that the Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and NordVPN. By visiting the
                website, registering for, installing and/or using the NordVPN Services on any platform or device you
                agree to be bound by these Terms. It is only under these Terms that NordVPN allows visitors / users (the
                “users”) to use NordVPN Services. If you do not agree to these Terms or any provisions hereof, please do
                not install and do not use our software, our mobile application and/or any of our products or services.

                If you are using the NordVPN Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for
                that organization and acknowledging that you have the authority to act on behalf of that organization
                and commit to these Terms on behalf of that organization.

                NordVPN Services are transitory digital network communications services, which enhance internet security
                and privacy. We do not condone any unlawful use of the NordVPN Services. NordVPN Services shall not be
                used for any criminal, illicit and illegal acts, and you accept and agree not to violate any law of any
                jurisdiction that you are originating from and any other applicable law. It is your (user’s)
                responsibility to know and comprehend any and all relevant laws related to any jurisdiction or venue
                that concerns you, your actions and your use of NordVPN Services.

                NordVPN guarantees a strict no-logs policy for NordVPN Services, meaning that the NordVPN Service is
                provided by an automated process, and your activities while using it are not monitored, recorded,
                logged, stored or passed to any third party. We do not store connection timestamps, session information,
                used bandwidth, traffic logs, IP addresses or other data. However, to limit the number of simultaneous
                sessions of an active user, an algorithm keeps their username and the timestamp of the last session
                status while the session is active. This data is wiped within 15 minutes after the session is
                terminated.

                Only basic payment information is processed through our payment service providers (e.g. Stripe,
                Credorax, Adyen, Payssion, etc.) and payment processing partners authorized to provide services within
                respective country (e.g. payments for the EU are processed by Moonflash Limited, registered at Regent
                House, 316 Beulah Hill, London, United Kingdom, SE19 3HF and for the US – Lagosec, Inc. registered at
                2035 Sunset Lake Rd., Suite B-2, Newark, Delaware, United States, DE 19702).

                By using NordVPN Services, you agree to the whole NordVPN Terms of Service including all said general
                provisions incorporated by reference.

                NordVPN may modify the Terms from time to time. The Terms are binding from the time that they are
                updated on our website. It is your responsibility to check and read current Terms periodically. The
                amendment of Terms may be communicated to you by sending an email and/or by publishing the updated Terms
                on the NordVPN website.

                If you have questions or concerns regarding these Terms please contact us at support@nordvpn.com.</p>



            <h6>Our services</h6>

            <p>NordVPN Services are transitory digital network communications services, which enhance internet security
                and privacy. At your individual request and at your sole discretion we automatically provide
                unsupervised and non-monitored data conduit – virtual private network (VPN) connection – for your
                exclusive use, at your own risk and responsibility. You are solely and exclusively responsible for the
                use of the NordVPN Services. NordVPN will not be liable in any way or form for actions done by its users
                including criminal liability and civil liability for harm executed or not executed. NordVPN liability is
                further limited by other provisions of these Terms.

                We grant you a permission to use the NordVPN Services subject to the restrictions set forth in these
                Terms. Your use of the NordVPN Services is at your own risk. The NordVPN Services may be modified,
                updated, interrupted or suspended at any time without notice or liability. We do not bear any liability
                for any harm or other adverse consequences to you, caused by this. NordVPN, its owners, employees,
                agents and others that are involved with the NordVPN services are not in any way or form liable for any
                harm of any kind executed or not executed, resulting from or arising through or from the use of any
                account registered with NordVPN services.

                NordVPN allows a maximum of six simultaneous connections per account. That includes proxy connections,
                and each of them counts as a separate slot.

                NordVPN guarantees a 99.9% service uptime. In any event, NordVPN shall not be liable for any loss,
                monetary or non-monetary harm beyond what the client paid to NordVPN, and this shall not include
                attorney fees or court costs irrespective of any laws or statutes that prescribe otherwise.

                NordVPN collects and processes very limited user data. Further information about user data processing is
                provided in the Privacy Policy and User Data section of the Terms.</p>

            <h6>No-logs policy</h6>

            <p>NordVPN guarantees a strict no-logs policy for NordVPN Services, meaning that the NordVPN Service is
                provided by an automated process, and your activities while using it are not monitored, recorded,
                logged, stored or passed to any third party. We do not store connection timestamps, session information,
                used bandwidth, traffic logs, IP addresses or other data. However, to limit the number of simultaneous
                sessions of an active user, an algorithm keeps their username and the timestamp of the last session
                status while the session is active. This data is wiped within 15 minutes after the session is
                terminated.

                NordVPN does not condone or endorse any unlawful, illicit, criminal or fraudulent activities perpetrated
                by using the NordVPN Services. Therefore, NordVPN reserves the right to suspend or terminate an account
                in case any violation of the Terms of Service becomes apparent. As NordVPN protects and respects
                customer privacy, it does not log or track their activity in any way. However, in the eventuality that
                NordVPN would find out about an offense outside of those means (i.e., a customer would notify NordVPN of
                them having done so), it would have the right to suspend or terminate the account.</p>

            <h6>Intellectual property rights</h6>

            <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, personal,
                non-transferable, non-sublicensable, license to: (1) download and use a copy of the NordVPN software;
                and (2) use the NordVPN Services, including, without limitation, the products and services made
                available on or through the NordVPN software or our website. No other right or license of any kind is
                granted to you hereunder with respect to the NordVPN Services. The license provided herein is effective
                until terminated. This license automatically terminates if you fail to comply with these Terms.

                The NordVPN Services, including, but not limited to, the NordVPN software, mobile application and all
                other items, are owned and copyrighted by NordVPN, and are protected worldwide. We retain all right,
                title and interest in and to the NordVPN Services and any portion thereof, including, without
                limitation, all copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other intellectual property
                rights. You shall not take any action to jeopardize, limit or interfere in any manner with our ownership
                of and rights with respect to the NordVPN Services. All rights are reserved unless otherwise noted.</p>

            <h6>Minors</h6>

            <p>NordVPN Services may be used by persons aged at least 18 years old. You are disallowed to connect and use
                the NordVPN Services if you are a minor, a competitor of our business, if you have been or are
                prohibited to access the NordVPN Services, or if your account has been suspended or closed due to any
                reason.</p>

            <h6>Payments</h6>

            <p>NordVPN Services are subscribed on a service period basis. You choose the service period and the payment
                method yourself when you sign up for the NordVPN Services. The NordVPN app for any platform or operating
                system supported by NordVPN can be downloaded free of charge. Users will have to purchase a paid
                subscription from NordVPN to connect to the NordVPN Service, except in the case of a limited free trial
                or certain coupon offers.

                Your service will automatically be renewed and your chosen payment method will be charged at the end of
                each service period, repeating the length of the previous service period, unless you decide to cancel
                your subscription for the NordVPN Services.</p>

            <h6>Refund policy</h6>

            <p>If you wish to claim a refund, you can do so within 30 days following your purchase of NordVPN Service.
                We seek your full satisfaction with our services. However, we would like to troubleshoot an issue you
                experience first. There are common VPN service configuration issues that may hinder NordVPN service for
                you and we resolve most of user issues encountered.

                Subscriptions purchased via the iTunes/App Store are subject to iTunes/App Store refund policies. This
                means we cannot grant refunds if you purchased an app through iTunes/App Store – you will have to
                contact store support for that. Payments made using prepaid cards or gift cards will not be refunded.
                NordVPN cannot refund any purchases made from our resellers (Amazon, BestBuy, StackSocial, etc.). In
                this case, refunds are handled according to the terms of service of the reseller from which the product
                was purchased. For payments made in cryptocurrency, the equivalent amount in US Dollars will be refunded
                in the same cryptocurrency (based on the rate of exchange at the moment of refund).

                You have a right to cancel your account at any time. You can cancel a recurring subscription from your
                website profile, iTunes/App Store or Google Play Store. Cancelled accounts will not be refunded for the
                unused part of the ongoing service period.

                NordVPN reserves the right to suspend or refuse service to anyone at any time for any reason. No refunds
                will be considered for accounts terminated for violation of these Terms.</p>

            <h6>Prohibited and restricted uses</h6>

            <h6>User data</h6>

            <p>You agree to read our Privacy Policy, which explains what type of information we collect and what might

                all activities that occur under your account or password, whether or not authorized by you. You agree to
                immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account, username or password, as the case may be.

            <h6>Disclaimer of warranties</h6>

            <p>Reasonable efforts are taken to improve the accuracy and integrity of the NordVPN Services, but we are
                not responsible for downtime, loss of data, corrupt data, service delay, mistakes, out-of-date
                information, or other errors. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, we reserve the right
                to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to the NordVPN Services, or any functionality comprising a
